Used NLTK took in doing the sentiment analysis. 
Sentiment analysis was done on the data that was scraped from Twitter. Data was mostly that tagged Donald Trump in the tweets during the time of Elections.
In the python file surprise ratings, I predicted surprise ratings from 500 text documents that gave the details of health reviews from three different users. Used NLTK and gensim from python to do the text modelling and predicting the average suprise rating of the individuals.
